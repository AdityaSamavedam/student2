<p>‚ÄòThe Mandalorian‚Äô finally comes into focus, while giving out a ‚ÄòRebels‚Äô yell</p>

<p>Editor‚Äôs Note: The following contains spoilers about the fifth episode of ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian,‚Äù Season 3, ‚ÄúThe Pirate.‚Äù</p>

<p>CNN ‚Äî</p>

<p>After what can at best be described as a somewhat disjointed third season thus far, the fifth episode of ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù began to bring those pieces together and into focus, while continuing to draw upon the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù animated series that preceded it, including another cameo by a character from the rightfully lauded ‚ÄúRebels.‚Äù</p>

<p>Subtitled ‚ÄúThe Pirate,‚Äù the episode presented further evidence of the dysfunctional nature of the New Republic, unable or unwilling to defend a faraway planet from an invading band of pirates. (Lucasfilm being a unit of Disney, the marauders had a certain ‚ÄúYo ho, yo ho‚Äù vibe to them.)</p>

<p>The siege also played into Mandalorian politics, and the efforts of Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) to reclaim her heritage and potentially reunite her people‚Äôs various tribes, after leading them, along with Din Djarin (voiced by Pedro Pascal), to the rescue of his pal Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) and the planet‚Äôs residents.</p>

<p>Still, the most pleasing moment for longtime ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù fans was likely what amounted to a throwaway scene, introducing a live-action version of the hulking alien Zeb, a character from the animated ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels,‚Äù which concluded in 2018. ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù has drawn heavily from those properties, which were overseen by one of its executive producers, Dave Filoni. (In another nice touch, Steve Blum again provided the voice of the character, and Zeb looked a whole lot better than the pirate leader.)</p>

<p>Finally, the episode closed with evidence that the evil Moff Gideon (played by Giancarlo Esposito previously) had seemingly been freed from the prison ship that was transporting him to stand trial, reviving that potential threat.</p>

<p>Having resolved the fate of Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, during the first two seasons, ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù has thus moved on to fill in narrative gaps about an under-explored chapter in ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù history ‚Äì namely, the factors that resulted in the fall of the New Republic and the rise of the First Order, the plot line featured in the most recent trilogy that began with ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a rebellion anymore,‚Äù a bureaucrat (played by Tim Meadows) says about what happens outside of the New Republic‚Äôs jurisdiction, conveying an indifference to the fate of the planet Nevarro overtly articulated later when it was observed that the governing body in Coruscant ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù</p>

<p>Executive producers Jon Favreau and Filoni have taken their time in reaching this point, juggling these various issues in somewhat ungainly fashion through the first half of the season. That perhaps reflects the transition of the show to an emphasis on the macro instead of the micro, while still finding time to detour for the occasional ‚ÄúRebels‚Äù yell.</p>

<p>‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô still has bite at 30, and here‚Äôs why</p>

<p>CNN ‚Äî</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been 30 years since Steven Spielberg‚Äôs dinosaurs stampeded across the screen in the first ‚ÄúJurassic Park,‚Äù but it feels more recent.</p>

<p>I was 12 in June of 1993 and vividly remember watching with glee when the Tyrannosaurus Rex, with its teeny arms and perpetual scowl, blew the walls of the bathroom down like a big bad wolf and promptly ate the lawyer character (played to hilarious effect by Martin Ferrero). Part of this, surely, had to do with the fact that I was a mouthy pre-teen, and many adults in my sphere at the time opined that I ‚Äúwould make a great lawyer‚Äù just like my father ‚Äì a fate I abhorred.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I was the exact target audience for this creature feature, and even though I was already somewhat of a self-taught critic (note the aforementioned mouthiness), I was awed by what I saw that summer three decades ago, and my impressions of ‚ÄúJurassic Park‚Äù remain to this day.</p>

<p>Joseph Mazzello in ‚ÄúJurassic Park.‚Äù Amblin/Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock</p>

<p>Part of that lasting impact, of course, has to do with the still-groundbreaking effects in the movie, which surprisingly hold up, and on a fairly hi-tech 72-inch TV screen to boot. While the first dino money shot ‚Äì of the plant-eating brachiosaurus ‚Äì might look just a tad soupy in 2023, it still looks considerably better than more contemporary fare, and the ensuing imagery of the more predatory beasts (like T-rex and especially those raptors) remains top-notch. The computer-generated imagery in the movie is essentially credited with marking the end of stop-motion animation as the go-to effects option for films such as these, notably used in everything that came before, from 1933‚Äôs ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù to 1981‚Äôs ‚ÄúClash of the Titans.‚Äù The animatronics are something to behold as well, particularly the ailing triceratops responsible for that ‚Äúone big pile of s‚Äî,‚Äù one of many priceless quips uttered by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).</p>

<p>The appeal of ‚ÄúJurassic,‚Äù based on Michael Crichton‚Äôs acclaimed novel, is also largely due to the film‚Äôs suspenseful and pared-down pacing, which of course can be linked to Spielberg, who learned a thing or two about keeping his cards close to his chest with ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù ‚Äì the great white mother of all creature features that famously showed startlingly little of the big fish before the climax.</p>

<p>Another ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù connection is prolific film composer John Williams, the Spielberg collaborator who created a majestic score for ‚ÄúJurassic Park‚Äù that is still synonymous with an air of discovery, one that can easily be hummed when looking upon any great view or upon entering a new and uncharted space.</p>

<p>Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Joseph Mazzello in ‚ÄúJurassic Park.‚Äù Amblin/Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock</p>

<p>And then there‚Äôs the casting, an element that sometimes takes a number of years to truly appreciate. Aside from the always-dependable Goldblum, there‚Äôs Laura Dern, who carved out her own Sigourney Weaver-shaped notch in the movie thanks to that one terrifying sequence in the control shed. Plus, her reaction shot to that first dinosaur reveal ‚Äì along with that of Sam Neill ‚Äì could be viewed as a textbook for green-screen acting, which has become the standard ever since, in Marvel movies and beyond. Add to that the amazing and meme-worthy smaller performances from Samuel L. Jackson (‚ÄúHold onto your butts!‚Äù), Wayne Knight (‚ÄúAh ah ah! You didn‚Äôt say the magic word!‚Äù) and Bob Peck (‚ÄúClever girl‚Äù), and you‚Äôve got a crowd-pleaser that is equal parts adventure, comedy and chomp-chomp thriller.</p>

<p>While the rest of the entries in the ‚ÄúJurassic‚Äù franchise have not exactly been up to par (aside from 2015‚Äôs not-terrible first reboot ‚ÄúJurassic World‚Äù), the original flick still ‚Äúrules‚Äù ‚Äì and is definitely worth a rewatch on the occasion of its 30th birthday.</p>

<p>Putin puts doomsday Satan-2 nuclear weapon ‚Äòthat can sink Britain‚Äô on combat duty for the first time</p>

<p>The Armageddon weapon can be loaded with multiple nuclear warheads</p>

<p>Its deployment - if the move is for real - comes after only one proven test launch</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin today put the world‚Äôs most powerful Armageddon nuclear rocket dubbed Satan-2 on combat duty.</p>

<p>The ‚Äòunstoppable‚Äô 15,880mph intercontinental missile system, known to Russians as Sarmat, is the size of a 14-storey tower block.</p>

<p>The announcement came from Yury Borisov, head of the Russian Space Agency.</p>

<p>‚ÄòThe Sarmat strategic complex has been put on combat duty,‚Äô he told students at an educational event.</p>

<p>He gave no further details.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin today put the world‚Äôs most powerful Armageddon nuclear rocket dubbed Satan-2 on combat duty (pictured launching in April 2022)</p>

<p>In June the Russian leader threatened the West with his new Satan-II big-beast 208-ton nuclear apocalypse rocket while speaking to military graduates in the Grand Kremlin Palace</p>

<p>The 208-ton missile had been due to go on duty at the end of last year but was mysteriously delayed.</p>

<p>Russian propagandists have boasted one strike could sink Britain under the sea.</p>

<p>The move comes as Russia is smarting from setbacks in the war in Ukraine, as Kyiv gains ground and subjects Putin‚Äôs territory to increasing drone attacks.</p>

<p>Yet its deployment - if the move is for real - comes after only one proven test launch.</p>

<p>Others were forecast but not announced.</p>

<p>It also comes soon after the Russian Space Agency faced international humiliation over its failed moon mission last month.</p>

<p>Nine months ago Putin threatened: ‚ÄòIn the near future, Sarmat ICBMs will be put on combat duty for the first time.</p>

<p>‚ÄòWe know there will be a certain delay in time but this does not change our plans ‚Äì everything will be done.‚Äô</p>

<p>In June he boasted: ‚ÄòIn the nearest future the first launch pads of Sarmat [Satan-2] with a new heavy missile will be put on combat duty‚Ä¶‚Äô</p>

<p>The Armageddon weapon can be loaded with multiple nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>Putin TV propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov - also deputy head of the company running state run Rossiya 1 channel - threatened Britain in revenge for a comment then premier Boris Johnson never made about striking Russia with a nuclear attack.</p>

<p>Downing Street dismissed the claim - widely repeated in Russia‚Äô state media - as ‚Äòanother example of disinformation peddled by the Kremlin‚Äô, but it continues to be trumpeted in Moscow.</p>

<p>Russia has claimed its most potent nuclear missile, the 16,000mph hypersonic ‚ÄòSatan-2‚Äô, can destroy the UK</p>

<p>The giant missile - which can allegedly reach the UK in just three minutes and is known as Sarmat to Russians - has experienced embarrassing development delays</p>

<p>Putin‚Äôs ‚Äòpropagandist-in-chief‚Äô Dmitry Kiselyov previously threatened to drown Britain twice in a radioactive tidal wave using Satan-2 missile</p>

<p>‚ÄòThe island is so small that one Sarmat missile is enough to drown it once and for all,‚Äô said Kiselyov.</p>

<p>‚ÄòRussian missile Sarmat [Satan-2], the world most powerful‚Ä¶is capable of ‚Ä¶ destroying an area the size of Texas or England.</p>

<p>‚ÄòA single launch, Boris, and there is no England anymore.</p>

<p>‚ÄòOnce and for all.‚Äô</p>

<p>The first and only known full-scale test of Satan-2 was announced to great fanfare as soon as it took place on April 20, 2022, with Putin in touch by video-link.</p>

<p>The silo-based Satan-2 launch was from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.</p>

<p>The following month, former head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin, seen as a close Putin ally, said almost 50 Satan-2 missiles, which were in mass production, would soon be on combat duty.</p>

<p>In early June, a major ICBM test was scheduled and locals near the Kura test range were warned to stay clear of the target site in remote Kamchatka.</p>

<p>But this test never happened.</p>

<p>Russian propagandists have boasted one strike could sink Britain</p>

<p>On 25 June last year Rogozin boasted: ‚ÄòWe are absolutely on schedule, we are now preparing for the second flight test of the Sarmat.‚Äô</p>

<p>The following month Rogozin was fired for unknown reasons with his promised new job yet to arrive.</p>

<p>His successor, ex-deputy premier Borisov, in July 2022 repeated the claim that the missile is in mass production without reiterating Putin‚Äôs goal of Satan-2 being on combat duty by December of last year.</p>

<p>Defence analysts suspecting hypersonic hyperbole pointed out that Russia‚Äôs R-36M2 Voevoda missile was tested no less than 17 times before it was put on combat duty.</p>

<p>Some experts will doubt the reality of today‚Äôs announcement.</p>

<p>Another missile - RT-2PM Topol - was tested a dozen times before deployment.</p>

<p>‚ÄòIn this context, the truth of the terms bandied about by Rogozin ‚Äî that Sarmat is in [serial] production and is soon to be placed on ‚Äòcombat duty‚Äô ‚Äî appear dubious,‚Äô defence expert Leonid Nersisyan has said.</p>

<p>‚ÄòIt is far likelier that Sarmat will undergo the same testing, prototyping and experimentation programme as its predecessors,‚Äô he wrote in Shephard Media.</p>

<p>Russia takes its hypersonic Satan-2 [Sarmat] missile into a forest ahead of ‚Äònew tests‚Äô amid acute tension with the West</p>

<p>‚ÄòActual acceptance of the ICBM into service with the Strategic Missile Forces ‚Ä¶is hardly achievable by 2024.‚Äô</p>

<p>More than a year ago, Rogozin visited the Krasmash defence factory in Krasnoyarsk, in eastern Siberia, which he labelled the ‚ÄòDoomsday Plant‚Äô, to inspect the process of producing Satan-2 for flight tests.</p>

<p>The missile was rolled out into a forest for the cameras - and sabre-rattling Rogozin said: ‚ÄòThe world‚Äôs most powerful global-range nuclear-tipped missile is being prepared for new tests.‚Äô</p>

<p>Yet there is no evidence these tests happened.</p>

<p>Letters: Barack Obama is not the fan we need for new ownership of the White Sox</p>

<p>Then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama heads out to the mound to throw out the first pitch of Game 2 of the American League Championship Series between the White Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on Oct. 12, 2005. (Charles Cherney, Chicago Tribune)</p>

<p>I must disagree with Charlie Stanton‚Äôs op-ed that Barack Obama is the right guy to be the next owner of the White Sox (‚ÄúWhy Barack Obama should be the next owner of the White Sox,‚Äù Aug. 29).</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Other than abandoning the South Side for Hawaii and Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, Obama knows little to nothing about the Sox.</p>

<p>In April 2010 when Obama was president, he joined the broadcast booth for a Washington Nationals game. Obama went on about how he‚Äôs a South Side guy and a Sox fan. When he was asked who his favorite Sox player was, he couldn‚Äôt name one player. The broadcasters also took pity when he mispronounced Comiskey Park as ‚ÄúCominskey Park.‚Äù</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs hope Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Chicago reach an agreement or a true White Sox fan steps up to become the next owner.</p>

<p>‚Äî Bruce R. Hovanec, Chicago</p>

<p>What about His Airness?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a lifelong Cubs fan, and the White Sox leaving town would feel like losing an arm. The rivalry between the Cubs and Sox is in our DNA.</p>

<p>Letter writer Pat Barrett (‚ÄúBring Theo Epstein aboard,‚Äù Aug. 28) suggests that Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf should hire Theo Epstein. Capital idea, but I say go one better. Reinsdorf could sell a big stake in the team to a former Sox player who is universally loved and a proven (six-time) winner: Michael Jeffrey Jordan.</p>

<p>‚Äî Al Szopinski, Chicago</p>

<p>White Sox overshadowed</p>

<p>The White Sox have always labored in the summer shadow of the Cubs. Wrigley Field was for decades a favorite place to spend an afternoon and, starting in 1988, a summer evening. In the early 1960s, Philip K. Wrigley thought the answer to an abysmal team was to replace the field manager with eight coaches. This was referred to as the College of Coaches.</p>

<p>Visitors made Wrigley Field a tourist stop. Winning was incidental; the ambience was critical. The accepted reason for decades of Cubs losses was a curse placed upon it by the goat-toting owner of the most famous and best burger joint in town. Gratefully, the curse has since been repealed.</p>

<p>In 1987, Cubs great Andre Dawson was named the National League‚Äôs MVP, even though the Cubs finished the season buried in last place.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Cubs fans have been thought of as classy while the White Sox have attracted a working-class crowd. Prior to 1988, the Cubs played all their home games during the day. This generally meant that while the working class was at work, Cubs fans were staggering around the streets in a beer stupor at 4 p.m. after drinking brewskis from batting practice until a game‚Äôs last out. When the Sox swept the 2005 World Series, the Cubs, the National League‚Äôs fourth-placed team, outdrew the world champions that season by about 700,000 fans.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs clear that easier, more accessible parking, better food and a historically superior-performing team are just not up to the standards of the once-a-century-America‚Äôs-favorite Cubs.</p>

<p>Who can blame Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf if he moves or sells the team?</p>

<p>Nuances of domestic abuse</p>

<p>Thanks so much for publishing the op-ed ‚ÄúWe must expand the definition of domestic violence to include emotional abuse‚Äù by So‚Äôphelia Morrow (Aug. 28). The contact information listed at the end was also especially helpful to anyone who is a domestic violence victim.</p>

<p>I am a volunteer at Sarah‚Äôs Inn, a domestic violence agency in Forest Park. I answer phone calls from many women who do not think they are domestic violence victims. They will start out saying, ‚ÄúI do not know if I am a victim because I have not been hit or physically hurt.‚Äù Then they will describe the emotional abuse that Morrow speaks of in her op-ed, such as verbal put-downs or spousal disrespect.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The women will often not realize that there is financial abuse as well. For example, they will say, ‚ÄúI cannot leave because the car and the house are listed in only his name.‚Äù They do not realize that assets gained during a marriage are marital property, regardless of whose name is on the deed or title. The law in Illinois views marital property as belonging to both spouses. A judge decides who gets how much based on income, earning power, contributions to the marriage, etc.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see some press about this issue. It affects more people than we realize.</p>

<p>A South Side wartime wedding</p>

<p>Regarding ‚ÄúLong-ago coverage of weddings captured grandeur, delightful quirks ‚Äî and boredom‚Äù (Aug. 27): My letter is about a wartime wedding at St. Leo‚Äôs parish on the South Side of Chicago in June 1944. My dad, a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, was home on a five-day leave before shipping out to England to be a bombardier on a B-17 bomber headed to Germany. He had been a student at DePaul University, and my mom was a recent Chicago Teachers College graduate. St. Leo‚Äôs pastor knew them as both played the massive pipe organ at his church. He told them that if no one died, they could get married at the 9:30 Mass on Saturday.</p>

<p>Retail tycoon Marshall Field had a saying, ‚ÄúGive the lady what she wants,‚Äù so Mom and the bridesmaids were given an incredible wedding. The groomsmen and mutual friends who were also home that week on leave were in their military uniforms. The reception was held at a club called the Medinah where my grandparents were members. It was not a society wedding but rather a wartime wedding.</p>

<p>South Side friendships during wartime made families cling a little bit tighter to each other. Service flags in house windows let others know that families were awaiting a safe return for their service member.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>There were no famous society names or affiliations at this wedding. It was just a wartime wedding in Chicago in June 1944.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù language due to its comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>JavaScript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users‚Äô devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gorillas are herbivorous,  predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.
Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35‚Äì40 years in the wild. 
Gorillas‚Äô natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.</p>

<h3 id="python-data-types">Python Data Types</h3>
<p>Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.  Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations.  In the illustration below there are two functions</p>
<ul>
  <li>mean‚Ä¶ shows types required prior to calling average function</li>
  <li>average, average2‚Ä¶ calculates the average of a list of numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>Python has types.  In the language you can use type hints, but most coders do not use them.  In other languages like Java and ‚ÄòC‚Äô you must specify types.</p>

human
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A man is an adult male human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent).
Like most other male mammals, a man‚Äôs genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition. Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, and by secondary sex characteristics, including a narrower pelvis, narrower hips, and smaller breasts.
Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited men‚Äôs activities and opportunities. Men often face conscription into military service or are directed into professions with high mortality rates. Many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for men, such as religious circumcision. Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence.
Trans men have a gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, while intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology.</p>

<p>Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The primary functions which distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.
Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value. Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ‚Äúall debts, public and private‚Äù, in the case of the United States dollar.
The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, whose value exists on the books of financial institution, can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment and forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>orangutan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast Asia and South China. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). A third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), was identified definitively in 2017. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which diverged genetically from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.
The most arboreal of the great apes, orangutans spend most of their time in trees. They have proportionally long arms and short legs, and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. Adult males weigh about 75 kg (165 lb), while females reach about 37 kg (82 lb). Dominant adult males develop distinctive cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals; younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes: social bonds occur primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan‚Äôs diet; but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. They can live over 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.
Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes‚Äô learning abilities have been studied extensively. There may be distinctive cultures within populations. Orangutans have been featured in literature and art since at least the 18th century, particularly in works that comment on human society. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutƒó Galdikas and they have been kept in captive facilities around the world since at least the early 19th century.
All three orangutan species are considered critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching (for bushmeat and retaliation for consuming crops), habitat destruction and deforestation (for palm oil cultivation and logging), and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.</p>

<p>JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users‚Äô devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
