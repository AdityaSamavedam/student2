<p>The person may face $250,000 in fines and up to 10 years in jail.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-and-intellectual-property"><span style="color:pink">Copyright and Intellectual Property</span></h2>

<p>Copyright is the legal right that the creator of a work has to it. The WIPO defines two types of rights under copyright:</p>

<p>Economic Rights: rights to financial benefits from the use of the work</p>

<p>Moral rights :rights that aren’t financial but are still important. For example, the right to claim authorship or the right to prevent harmful changes.</p>

<p>Copyright is not a new concept. Copyright laws have been around since the 18th century. However, the digital age has created new challenges to copyright and demands new ways to protect it as well.</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copyright gives the creator the right to prevent others from exploiting their work.</li>
  <li>Copyright promotes fair innovation.
Copyright provides financial benefits to users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives of copyright:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copyright laws can get in the way of creative freedom as creators can get scared of  building upon previous works because of copyright protection.</li>
  <li>Copyright only offers limited protection. For example, copyright protects a particular expression of an idea (as in images, words or sounds) but it does not protect the idea or concept itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using content created by someone else without permission or citation can have consequences, such as a fine or an order to remove copyrighted content.</p>

<p>If you claim the said content was your own, even unintentionally, you might be found guilty of plagiarism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/f9sn-NNCl2sajrRI5NOEuJsQjkM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/copyright-4198743-01-FINAL-a21594dd0b6344f583f9ded410d8d6f8.jpg" alt="Copyright Image" width="300" height="200" /></p>

<h2 id="plagiarism"><span style="color:pink">Plagiarism</span></h2>

<p>Plagiarism is when you take the content of someone else and claim it as your own. The most common type of plagiarism students hear about is the plagiarism of written ideas and/or phrases. It’s possible to accidentally plagiarize by simply forgetting to cite the original source of an idea or phrase.</p>

<p>Plagiarism can have serious consequences, especially in the world of academia. It can get students expelled and see the careers of professors destroyed. Furthermore, there could be legal consequences as well.</p>

<p>It’s not difficult in the age of image searches and Turnitin.com to be caught plagiarizing or violating copyright. It can also be incredibly disheartening for content creators to see their hard work taken without permission or credit.</p>

<h2 id="gpl-and-black-duck"><span style="color:pink">GPL and Black Duck:</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In companies like Qualcomm, patents have been a way for the company to gain revenue. However, a term known as GPL(General public license) can create clashes with the legal rights of patents. GPL is known as the right for users to manipulate and use the software for their own benefits. GPL protects your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. An example is linux. Linux is open-source(original code which is made free and available for the public.) software, and users have the freedom to view, modify, and distribute the source code, provided they also distribute any modifications under the same GPL license terms. Open source licensing also contributed to helping both contributors and users and they are a binding legal contract between author and user that declares the certain conditions in which a piece of software can be used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back to qualcomm, GPL can prohibit people from making money off of their patents, which doesn’t favor the creators of the code. Qualcomm instead wants something known as royalty payment where the ones using the code, patent, or idea should pay royalty. Royalty payment is defined as a regular fee paid by a licensee to a licensor in exchange for the licensee to gain access to the licensors code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) is a tool that helps development teams manage risks linked to open source and third-party code in applications and containers. It addresses security, quality, and license compliance concerns, ensuring software integrity by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities while maintaining adherence to licensing requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whoel comcept may sound simple and unimportant, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business.</p>

<h2 id="gnu"><span style="color:pink">GNU:</span></h2>

<ul>
  <li>GNU Stands for “GNU’s Not Unix,” an open-source operating system.</li>
  <li>It is rooted in software freedom, emphasizing users’ rights to run, study, modify, and share software.</li>
  <li>It includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and essential libraries, forming the foundation for various software applications.</li>

<h1 id="extra-credit"><span style="color:cadetblue">Extra Credit</span></h1>

<p>Explain the significance of choosing an appropriate license for personal and team GitHub repositories, especially for the CPT project. How does this relate to the broader themes of legal and ethical concerns in computing?</p>

<p>My Answers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: It is dedicated to the public, hence all the creator’s/creators’ rights have been waived off to the work worldwide under copyright law. All users are allowed to modify, distribute and perform the work for any purpose, even commercially.
<br />
Open Source MIT License: This is also dedicated to the public, and allows all users to modify and distribute the software, as long as they follow the copyright rules described in the license.
<br />
Open Source GPL License: It is a copyleft open source license, meaning that it allows users to copy, distrubute and modify it without having to seek permission from the creator, however any of its derivative work must also be distributed under the GPL.
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li>Qualcomm: Qualcomm contributes to open source projects in mobile and wireless tech like Android and Linux. They integrate open source into their Snapdragon processors for mobile devices. Qualcomm makes money from proprietary hardware and tech that complements open source software.
<br /><br />
Red Hat: Red Hat is a major contributor to open source projects, especially the Linux kernel. They build their business on open source, notably with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Red Hat sells subscriptions, providing support and tools for their open source products, making open source more accessible to businesses with a reliable support structure.
<br />
<br /></li>
  <li>Businesses heavily relying on open source software need to generate income to sustain operations, provide support, and fund ongoing development. They often use a dual-licensing model, offering a free, open source version alongside a commercial version with additional features and support. By selling commercial licenses, support, and related services, these businesses can thrive while adhering to the principles of open source licensing.
<br />
<br />
Extra Credit: Choosing an appropriate license for personal and team GitHub repositories is crucial for the CPT project and aligns with broader legal and ethical concerns in computing. A well-defined license clarifies how others can use, modify, and distribute the project, fostering collaboration and preventing legal issues. Ethically, it ensures transparency and respect for intellectual property rights. By selecting licenses like the MIT or GPL, developers contribute to a culture of responsible and ethical software development, promoting innovation while respecting legal boundaries.</li>
