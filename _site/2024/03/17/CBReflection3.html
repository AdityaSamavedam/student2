<p>I did better than the previous CB quiz last tri, but it was still tricky and time was a constraint.</p>

<p><img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q4correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is D because the World Wide Web is not a network, it’s a system of linked pages, programs, and files that can be accessed through internet.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q47correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is B because the expression should be true if average rating and price range are BOTH correct. The first condition should be AND and not OR.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q53correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is A because if the number appears twice, the variable “count” should equal 2 and not the variable “position”.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q55correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is C because appending the last element would result in the same list as the original list, since append always adds to the end of the list. The last element must be inserted into the beginning of the list, hence the insert function must be used.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q58correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is D because the app doesn’t need to know the starting location of the user’s previous run to recommend the route. It needs to know the runner’s geographic position.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q59correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is C because the usernames on Adrianna’s contact list are already provided by Adrianna directly. To share Adrianna’s running route with nearby users, she needs their locations.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q62correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answer is C because the users whose running routes begin or end near a particular business location will be more likely to get ads. Users who sign up for a premium account can use the app ad-free.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q67correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answers are A and D because the chances of orange and purple are 3/8 each and the chance of blue is 1/4. In options B and C, the chances of orange and purple each is 1/8 and the chance of blue is 3/4, which is wrong.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q68correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answers are A and C because the algorithm removes the element if it’s equal to the element IMMEDIATELY BEFORE it. For A and C, the algorithm will not work and it won’t completely remove the duplicates.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q69correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answers are A and D because the metadata of the photo shows the date, time and geographical location. For goals related to this, one needs to see the metadata.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/student2/images/collegeboard3/Q70correction.png" />
<br />
<br />
The correct answers are A and C because the last letter in “left” needs to be the length of the string minus one. The letter in “right” should be n plus one all the way to length of string.</p>
