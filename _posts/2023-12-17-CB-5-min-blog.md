Compared to the CollegeBoard Practice MC Exam that I took at the end of the previous trimester (where I got a 62/66), this one was much more challenging than I expected, and the results pretty much speak for themselves. I was still happy to get over a 50, but I tried my best to focus on accuracy, and not time. Eventually, time will definitely play a big factor in the real exam, but I considered this as just a practice to evaluate how well I could answer the questions.

<br>
To my surprise, the questions were extremely diverse, and came from a huge variety of topics, which made it quite difficult for me.
