As a person who has focused mainly on Python code for about four years, Trimester 1 was extremely crucial and helpful to my career as a software developer. At the beginning of the trimester, I thought that it would just start off straight up hardcore programming, but what was very different was that we were introduced to Web Development, which focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was when I realized that code doesn't look pretty when its output just has plain text in it without any decoration. From here, I started to value Frontend development a lot more, as a program would look nearly perfect when the Backend and Frontend are connected together. To be honest, I wasn't really the type of person who would work in groups, as I usually preferred to work alone. However, our passion project changed it all. I met new people whom I've never really talked to before and together, we were successfully able to put up our own website. Not only did we work hard, but we also became great friends and collaborate with each other. I think this is really crucial in the long run, as you can't be a loner your whole life, because some things can only work with more people.
