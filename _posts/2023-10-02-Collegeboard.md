List of things I had to look up in the collegeboard quiz:

Citizen science - scientific research conducted with participation from the general public.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - standards organization for the Internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite.

Digital Divide -  the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology (ICT), and those that don't or have restricted access.

Redundant routing - a failover strategy that ensures every call connects by rerouting traffic to alternate destinations if the primary one fails.

lossy transformation - the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression

lossless transformation - class of data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data with no loss of information.

undecidable problem - one that should give a "yes" or "no" answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs

symmetric encryption - a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data.

crowdsourcing - collecting services, ideas or content through the contributions of a large group of people

Quiz corrections:

Question 46:
The answer is D because it is impossible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs.

Question 50:
The answer is B, as when the variable is being iterated through the entire list sequentially, which means that it should be a linear search.

Question 58:
The answer is A because some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time.

Question 64:
The answer is B and C. D is wrong because cloud storage sites allow users to share files easily, which could lead to increased concerns about copyrighted materials being illegally distributed online.
