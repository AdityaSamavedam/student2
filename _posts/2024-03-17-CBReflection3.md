I did better than the previous CB quiz last tri, but it was still tricky and time was a constraint.

The correct answer is C because appending the last element would result in the same list as the original list, since append always adds to the end of the list. The last element must be inserted into the beginning of the list, hence the insert function must be used.

<br>
The correct answer is D because the app doesn't need to know the starting location of the user's previous run to recommend the route. It needs to know the runner's geographic position.

<br>
<br>
The correct answer is C because the usernames on Adrianna's contact list are already provided by Adrianna directly. To share Adrianna's running route with nearby users, she needs their locations.

<br>

<br>
The correct answers are A and D because the chances of orange and purple are 3/8 each and the chance of blue is 1/4. In options B and C, the chances of orange and purple each is 1/8 and the chance of blue is 3/4, which is wrong.

<br>
<br>
The correct answers are A and C because the algorithm removes the element if it's equal to the element IMMEDIATELY BEFORE it. For A and C, the algorithm will not work and it won't completely remove the duplicates.
